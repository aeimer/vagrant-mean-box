# MEAN-BOX | A Ubuntu:xenial64 based MEAN-Stack for development

This MEAN (MongoDB Express Angular NodeJS) Stack is often used.

## What's inside?
- NodeJS
- Bower
- Angular-CLI
- Yo
- MongoDB

## Why
This Box is used and created for the open-source project: https://github.com/h-da/geli

## Use
I recommend you to copy the `[Vagrantfile.example]` and extend it to your needs.

_Note that you HAVE to set `config.ssh.username = "ubuntu'`. This is beacause we use the 'ubuntu/xenial64' box as base._
